# Blockchain-Based-Voting-App

Traditional
electoral process is vulnerable in regards to
security aspects and is usually very time consuming causing
threats to the important characteristics of election such as
transparency, privacy of voters & democracy . Our team
proposes to remove these inconveniences by implementing
the characteristics of blockchain technology such as
decentralization, transparency & immutability into the
voting scheme to make each vote secured, temperament free
and counted whilst providing privacy to voters, additionally
saving time and resources
